Sprint 1

This folder contains all Sprint 1 deliverables for our Software Engineering Final Project.  
As the Scrum Master, I will organize all sprint documentation here, including:

- Standup meetings
- Sprint backlog
- User stories (Trello screenshots or exports)
- Sprint planning notes
- Sprint retrospective

All Agile artifacts for Sprint 1 will be stored and maintained in this folder.
